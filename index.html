        <p> 1.Berlin </p>

        <p> My number one is Berlin. I have visited this city twice. The first time with my grandparents. The other time with my school class.</p>
        <p> Berlin is the capital of Germany and the biggest city with 3.8 inhabitants as well. There are many different things you can do in that city and also many different destinations you have to visit.</p>
        <ol> -German parliament</ol>
        <ol> -the Berlin Wall</ol>
        <ol> - the Brandenburg Gate</ol>
        <ol> -Tiergarten, Animal Garden</ol>
        <ol> -the TV Tower</ol>
        
        <p> If you are willing to spend a day in Potsdam you can visit the Sanssouci Park and Palace. It is a hour ride by train from "Berlin Mitte" and you will not be dissapointed. </p>
        <p> Sanssouci Park, laid out between 1744 and 1756, is considered the most celebrated example of Potsdam Rococo. The park includes a lovely Baroque flower garden, more than 3,000 fruit trees, and numerous greenhouses. 
</p>
<p> 2. Munich </p>
<p> Munich is located in the south of Germany and it is the capital of Bavaria. The city is just 70 miles away from my hometown, so it is very convienient to make day trip there. </p>
<p> Best known as the origin of the world famous Oktoberfest, Munich is one of the best places to visit in Germany with a great culture scene. Munich is home to several sophisticated opera houses and theaters like the National Theatre. The city center is an attractive blend of classic and modern architecture, teeming in historic churches, medieval walls and royal palaces as well as bustling shopping centers and nightlife venues. Munich’s Oktoberfest began in 1810 with a royal wedding celebration. Today, this famous beer festival draws millions of visitors every year to take part in the revelry that involves several gigantic beer tents, delicious Bavarian food and millions of liters of beer.</p>
<p> 5. Regensburg</p>
<p> Regensburg is my Hometown. One of Germany’s oldest towns, Regensburg is overflowing with medieval charm and vibrant student life. The mighty Danube flows through its center, and narrow winding alleyways crisscross its architecturally fascinating Old Town, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>

<p>Founded by the Romans as early as 179 A.D, this welcoming mid-sized Bavarian town is a treasure trove for culture and history lovers. Its most remarkable sights are the 310-meter-long Stone Bridge (Steinerne Brücke) over the Danube and the 13th-century Cathedral of St. Peter, whose marvelous Gothic spires dominate the cityscape.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Regensburg has more bars and pubs per square mile than any other city in Germany, including Wurstkuchl, the world’s oldest sausage tavern.</p>
